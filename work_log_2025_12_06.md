## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### 1. 🧱 Layout & Arrangement
- **Implemented `g+h` (Grid Horizontal):** Strict row alignment where all cards in a row share the same top Y-coordinate. Fixed 20px gap.
- **Implemented `g+v` (Grid Vertical):** True Masonry-style 5-column layout. Cards stack sequentially within each column based on their individual heights.
- **Center-on-Cursor:** All arrangements now snap the center-top of the group to the mouse cursor position.

### 2. ✋ Interaction & Workflow
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Implemented dragging for multiple selected nodes.
- **Smart Selection:** Dragging an unselected node instantly selects it (and deselects others) for immediate movement.
- **Copy (`c`):** Instant duplication of selected nodes. Copies are auto-selected and tagged with `card_copy_YYMMDD`.
- **Search:** Hitting Enter in search now selects all results, enabling a smooth *Search -> Select -> Copy -> Arrange* workflow.

### 3. 🎨 UI Polish
- **Text Selection:** Fixed issue where dragging cards highlighted text. Added `select-none` to card containers while keeping `select-text` on editable inputs.
- **Image Drag:** Disabled browser native image dragging (`draggable="false"`) to prevent "ghost" images when moving cards.
- **Spacing:** Standardized all grid gaps to 20px.

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Refactor `App.tsx` (currently too large).
- Verify "resistance" issue when starting drag.
