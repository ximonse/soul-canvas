The concept of mechanism is analyzed in terms of entities and [<b>activities</b>], organized such 
that they are productive of regular changes.
Examples show how mechanisms work in 
neurobiology and molecular biology.”</span></span>

  <span class="highlight"><span style="background-color: #ffd40080">“Yet, in our view, there is no adequate analysis of 
what mechanisms are and how they work in science.
We begin (Section 2) with a dualistic analysis of the concept of mech- 
anism in terms of both the entities and [<b>activities</b>] that compose them.
Sec- 
tion 3 argues for the ontic adequacy of this dualistic approach and indi- 
cates some of its implications for analyses of functions, causality, and laws.”</span></span>

  <span class="highlight"><span style="background-color: #ffd40080">“Section 4 uses the example of the mechanism of neuronal depolarization 
to demonstrate the adequacy of the mechanism definition.
Section 5 char- 
acterizes the descriptions of mechanisms by elaborating such aspects as 
hierarchies, bottom out [<b>activities</b>], mechanism schemata, and sketches.
This section also suggests a historiographic point to the effect that much 
of the history of science might be viewed as written with the notion of 
mechanism.”</span></span>

THINKING ABOUT MECHANISMS 
3 
Mechanisms are entities and [<b>activities</b>] organized such that they are 
productive of regular changes from start or set-up to finish or termi- 
nation conditions.
For example, in the mechanism of chemical neurotransmission, a presyn- 
aptic neuron transmits a signal to a post-synaptic neuron by releasing 
neurotransmitter molecules that diffuse across the synaptic cleft, bind to 
receptors, and so depolarize the post-synaptic cell.”</span></span>
